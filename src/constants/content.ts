You're not alone when you're with your Slimes. The community has been extended to Slimes Family Collection holders as well, creating a large and vibrant community of collectors, traders creators and beautiful humans. No judgement, all love. ",

From the luchador mask to the references to aztec gods. This is Xicano Futurism. We strive to have a culture of hospitality as well. From an active moderator staff, to a warm welcome for all new collectors - everyone from a Slime to a single SFC piece. You're an important part of what makes this fun. ",

We've launched a clothing and collectible company, we've built a community on art from top to bottom and we're barely even getting started. We're taking our time, taking over. ",
